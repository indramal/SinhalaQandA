      <p>
        This research aims to develop an intelligent Sinhala question-and-answer
        system to enhance technological resources for Sinhala language
        processing. This AI-driven system will provide an interactive platform
        for college students to engage in conversational, object-based learning
        in Sinhala. Voice input will facilitate questions, and responses will be
        delivered in Sinhala audio, enhancing immersion and usability. This
        manages a local Mongo database for knowledge storage and retrieval of
        the data system that wants access to relevant information. This
        interactive Sinhala Q&A system used BERT model achitecute and it is
        trained on Sinhala dataset. Overall system has capability to adapt
        according to objects available in the vision field and then generate
        responses based on the object specific context. Objectidentification is
        done by YOLO model. In addition to developing a Sinhala BERT NLP model,
        Sinhala NLP Wordpiece tokenizer and developing Sinhala Dataset suitable
        for Sinhala BERT modelare sub-contributions. Following result of this
        research can show that this system is an effective tool. When showing
        Banana tothe system and asking කෙසෙල් කියන්නේ මොනවද? (What arebananas?),
        system voice output will be පළතුරක් (a fruit). Inconclusion, this
        research will contribute to the field of educationaltechnology and by
        developing this system, college students will have access to a tool that
        can assist them in improving their knowledge and proficiency in the
        Sinhala language.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Natural
        Language Processing (NLP) technologies have led to significant
        developments in the field of question-and-answer systems.
        Question-and-answering systems are computer programs designed to
        interact with users in a conversational manner. They have gained
        popularity in various domains, including education, because they provide
        a convenient and interactive way of providing information and support.
        However, there is a lack of intelligent question-and-answer systems
        specifically tailored to the needs of Sinhala-speaking college students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sinhala is the official language of Sri Lanka and is spoken by a
        significant portion of the population. Considering the history of the
        Sinhala language and the cultural context of Sri Lanka , it is crucial
        to develop an intelligent Sinhala question and answer system by
        incorporating visual cues that can effectively address the needs of
        college students in their educational journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        The absence of an intelligent Sinhala question and answer system by
        incorporating visual cues for college students presents a significant
        limitation in the education landscape. Existing chatbot systems
        primarily focus on English or other widely spoken languages, neglecting
        the specific linguistic and cultural needs of Sinhala-speaking students.
        This limitation hampers effective communication, information retrieval,
        and academic support for these students, hindering their learning
        experience and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This research aims to present an approach to improve the knowledge of
        students, assist to students in general matters and interact in Sinhala
        Language based on objects currently working on. The following objectives
        were set for this research:
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, the research endeavors to construct an intelligent Sinhala
        question and answer system tailored for college students, equipped with
        the ability to adapt dynamically to varying contexts. This involves
        several sub-goals: developing a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        model specifically designed for Sinhala Q&A, creating an efficient NLP
        tokenizer tailored for Q&A applications, and assembling a comprehensive
        Sinhala dataset specifically curated for Q&A tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the study aims to design an intelligent system capable of
        discerning context based on objects within its visual field. This system
        will subsequently be integrated with the aforementioned question and
        answer system, enabling a holistic approach to contextual understanding
        and response generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this study aims to contribute to the field of educational
        technology by leveraging advancements in Natural Language Processing,
        computer vision, voice recognition, and artificial intelligence to
        develop an effective and efficient Sinhala question-and-answering system
        that can cater to the specific needs of college students.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the Sinhala question and answer system effectively
        delivered accurate and relevant responses in Sinhala, marking a
        significant advancement in Sinhala language processing. The system
        successfully assisted college students with their queries and
        information needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering of objectives of this study, the following conclusions can
        be mentioned:
      </p>
      <p>
        Development of interactive Sinhala question and answer system program
        for college student with capability to adapt according to the context of
        the object is successfully achieved. This system was able to understand
        the intent of the user's queries and provide appropriate responses,
        demonstrating its effectiveness in assisting college students with their
        queries and providing relevant information. The BERT architecture proves
        to be more suitable compared to contemporary architectures such as GPT
        and T5. This is because BERT utilizes only the encoder component of the
        Transformers architecture. It was introduced in 2018, and after
        conducting a thorough literature review, it was found that no research
        has been conducted using these modern BERT architectures for Sinhala
        language processing. By employing this method, highly accurate outputs
        can be obtained along with a deeper understanding of the Sinhala
        language model when compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, there
        is currently no developed Sinhala WordPiece tokenizer based on available
        literature. Therefore, any solutions utilizing Sinhala BERT are
        recommended due to their ability to handle larger vocabulary sizes. The
        resulting tokenizer encompasses an extensive vocabulary of 1,000,000
        words. Although it predominantly focuses on Sinhala words, there is also
        some inclusion of English and Tamil words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Development of intelligent system for identifying the context based on
        objects available in the vision field. Then combine with question and
        answer system program. This objective also has been successfully
        achieved. In specific scenarios, the utilization of Sinhala knowledge
        can be highly beneficial by maintaining a localized database. This
        advantage stems from the question and answer system's ability to offer
        users information that is more precise and pertinent to their individual
        requirements and circumstances. Furthermore, this approach presents
        advantages in terms of production as it has lower hardware demands,
        making it easily implementable even within resource-limited settings.
        The employed system relies on a NoSQL database, which facilitates faster
        processing when compared to SQL databases. By combining both visual and
        voice data processing techniques, this system excels at providing
        accurate answers tailored specifically for each query owing to its
        thorough understanding of related questions.
